[22]: ​If person A deposits \$100 into the bank, and the bank loans out \$90 of this \$100 to person B, person A will still think he or she has \$100 while person B will have \$90, for a total of \$190. What's more, if person B deposits the \$90 in the bank again , and the bank loans out \$81 of these \$90 to person C, three people will think they own a combined \$271. This can go on and on, seemingly bringing more and more money into circulation. This concept is referred to as the "money multiplier." And in actuality, the money multiplier can be even more aggressive than this conventional fractional reserve example suggests, because banks don't need to first receive deposits before they can issue loans; they can issue loans simply by creating it as credit in customers' bank accounts.

[41]: ​For the sake of accuracy, it should be noted that this part of the argument technically only came to prominence when Stallman launched the GNU project a year-or-so later; it hadn't yet been part of his original motivation to start the project in the first place. This minor anachronism was left in the text for the purpose of readability.

[50]: ​Richard Stallman is not a fan of this terminology either. If a term to include both sides of the schism must be used, he prefers "Free/Libre and Open Source Software" because it more clearly conveys that the "free" part is about "freedom."

[55]: ​This is sometimes considered "intrinsic value," which is a common expression in economics to signify that a good has economic use value apart from its monetary role. Austrians generally reject the idea that products actually have intrinsic value at all, however: value is always subjective.

[56]: ​More recent archeological research published in David Graeber's Debt: The First 5,000 Years , suggests that there was never a pure barter economy as described in the regression theorem. Instead, the oldest human civilizations used debt as their first currency. However, debt only works as currency in high-trust, reputation-based environments. In low-trust environments, gold was often the currency of choice, and it's entirely feasible that the precious metal garnered this status over time through a process resembling what is described in the regression theorem.

[104]:  Chaum would later also propose a solution where double-spending could de-anonymize the perpetrator, somewhat limiting the need to immediately check each incoming payment against the bank's records since the perpetrator of a double-spend attack can be identified.

[105]:  As a nifty extra detail, the system also embeds a type of fraud prevention check---albeit one that comes at the expense of privacy if and when users would opt to use it. If Carol would falsely claim that she'd never been paid, Bob could choose to reveal the nonce to Alice Bank, proving that he created the digital dollars that Carol deposited, proving that he paid them to her.

[106]:  That said, there are some other, perhaps more drastic measures that Alice Bank could have taken. Besides refusing to issue digital dollars to Bob in the first place, she could have also blocked all electronic cash payments. Similarly, she could block particular users from accepting payments; even if payments can't be traced, some users can still be excluded from participation in the system.

[107]:  It can  been argued that Chaum did use a rather loose definition of "cash," as cash typically has more distinguishing properties. Chaum's form of digital cash for example offered limited person-to-person transferability---a feature that physical cash does have, as it can freely be passed around. Regardless, Chaum invented a form of digital money that at least offered a similar level of privacy as physical cash, which was his main objective.

[210]:  It is worth noting however that this number---named after primatologist Robin Dunbar---has  been criticized, and isn't, in the scientific community today, held with the specificity that it suggests. While there is a limit on the number of stable social relationships people can maintain, the actual number isn't necessarily  150 for everyone. See for instance Patrick Lindenfors, Andreas Wartel, and Johan Lind, "'Dunbar's Number' Deconstructed," Biology Letters, May 5, 2021: <https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0158>

[213]:  In Szabo's original proposal, Bit Gold would actually use a "secure benchmark function," which is slightly different from a hash function, but similar enough that referring to the product as a "hash" and the act of producing it as "hashing" is accurate enough for the purpose of understanding Bit Gold's mechanics .

This most notably includes the price of labor  due to psychological factors.

[291]:  Since Bitcoin was ultimately released on January 8, this would have left the system's creator with a maximum of six days to comfortably generate coins in absence of any competition---but early block timestamps indicate that he didn't do this either.

[292]:  It's worth noting though that each bitcoin can be divided up to eight decimal points, so in a way there are 2.1 quadrillion currency units. The smallest unit, 0.00000001 bitcoin, is today usually referred to as a "satoshi," or "sat" for short.

[296]:  This most famously included the 1-megabyte block size limit, preventing the block chain from growing so fast that most regular users wouldn't be able to run a Bitcoin node on their home computer.

[297]:  The currently best-known example of such a payment layer is called the Lightning Network.
